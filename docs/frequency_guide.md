## What Are Audio Frequencies?

### The Basics

**Frequency** is measured in Hertz (Hz) and represents how many times per second a sound wave vibrates.

- **Low frequency (20 Hz)** = 20 vibrations per second = Deep bass
- **High frequency (20,000 Hz)** = 20,000 vibrations per second = High treble

### Human Hearing Range

**20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (20 kHz)**

However:
- Most adults can't hear above 16-18 kHz
- We *feel* frequencies below 30 Hz more than hear them
- Sensitivity varies with age and hearing health

### Why EQ Matters

Different frequencies create different sonic characteristics:
- **Boost bass** = More power and impact
- **Boost mids** = Clearer vocals
- **Boost treble** = More detail and sparkle

## Frequency Problems and Solutions

### Problem: Muddy Bass

**Symptoms:** Bass sounds unclear, boomy, masks vocals

**Frequencies:** Usually 100-300 Hz

**Solution:**
```
Reduce: -2 to -4 dB at 150-250 Hz
Or cut specific: -3 to -6 dB at problem frequency (use narrow Q)
```

### Problem: Harsh Vocals

**Symptoms:** Vocals sound sharp, fatiguing, sibilant

**Frequencies:** Usually 2.5-5 kHz or 6-8 kHz

**Solution:**
```
Reduce: -2 to -3 dB at 3000-5000 Hz
Or de-ess: -3 to -5 dB at 6000-8000 Hz (narrow Q)
```

### Problem: Thin Sound

**Symptoms:** Lacks body, sounds hollow

**Frequencies:** Missing 80-250 Hz

**Solution:**
```
Boost: +3 to +6 dB at 100-150 Hz (body)
Boost: +2 to +4 dB at 200-250 Hz (warmth)
```

### Problem: Boxiness

**Symptoms:** Sound confined, resonant, hollow

**Frequencies:** Usually 250-500 Hz

**Solution:**
```
Reduce: -2 to -4 dB at 300-500 Hz
```

### Problem: Lack of Presence

**Symptoms:** Vocals buried, instruments don't stand out

**Frequencies:** Missing 2-5 kHz

**Solution:**
```
Boost: +3 to +6 dB at 2500-4000 Hz
```

### Problem: Sibilance (Harsh "S" sounds)

**Symptoms:** "S" and "SH" sounds are sharp

**Frequencies:** Usually 5-8 kHz

**Solution:**
```
Reduce: -2 to -4 dB at 6000-7000 Hz (use Q 2.0-3.0)
```

## Frequency Interaction

### How Frequencies Affect Each Other

**Bass Masks Mids:**
- Too much 100-200 Hz can make vocals unclear
- Solution: Reduce low-mids or boost vocal frequencies

**Treble Compensates for Bass:**
- Heavy bass needs more treble for balance
- Add +2-3 dB treble when boosting bass heavily

**Room Acoustics:**
- Small rooms boost 100-150 Hz (standing waves)
- Large rooms can absorb high frequencies
- Corners amplify bass
