## Required Images

**Where to get:**
- Create a custom banner with text "Equalizer APO Professional Profiles"

**Alternative:** Text descriptions work fine without images

## Image Optimization

If you add images:

```bash
# Optimize PNG files to reduce size
# Use tools like:
# - TinyPNG (https://tinypng.com/)
# - ImageOptim (Mac)
# - PNGCrush (Command line)
```

## Using Images in Documentation

Reference images in markdown:

```markdown
![Description](images/filename.png)
```

Example:
```markdown
![Equalizer APO Logo](images/eq-apo-logo.png)
```

## Image Guidelines

**Do:**
- Use PNG for screenshots and logos
- Use JPG for photos
- Keep file sizes under 500 KB
- Use descriptive filenames
- Include alt text for accessibility

**Don't:**
- Upload large unoptimized images
- Use spaces in filenames
- Include personal information in screenshots

## Optional Images You Could Add

- **frequency-chart.png** - Visual frequency spectrum chart
- **before-after-graph.png** - Frequency response comparison
- **editor-screenshot.png** - Configuration Editor interface
- **profile-comparison.png** - Different profile curves
- **room-setup.png** - Example speaker/subwoofer placement

## If You Don't Want to Add Images

No problem! The documentation works perfectly fine without images. Simply:

1. Delete any image references from the markdown files
2. Or leave the image tags - they'll just show as broken image icons
3. Focus on clear text explanations instead

1. Use Canva.com (free)
2. Choose "Banner" template
